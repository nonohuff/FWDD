# Machine Learning Files

While we ultimately did not use any neural networks in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08984), we did explore them slightly. In this folder, we provide some of the files we created. Especially helpful may be the SLURM .sbatch files used to generate the training examples.

The code in this folder is old and likely has many bugs. It is only provided as a refernce, If you want to implement machine learning for neural network learning, you should write your own files utilizing the finctions in the main package, which will be much more robust. `cpmg_noise_NN.v6.ipynb` is an interactive notebook, where we implemented a neural network in addition to other functions. Feel free to take a peek, but it is also not finalized, and likely has bugs. *AGAIN, FEEL FREE TO USE THESE FILES AS A STARTING POINT WHERE IT IS HELPFUL, BUT YOU SHOULD WRITE YOUR OWN MACHINE LEARNING FILES.
